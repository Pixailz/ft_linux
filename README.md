## TODO

1. Save step done ..
1. Get, by chapter all sbu for estimation of compilation time
1. Some test are not correctly checked and therefore considered as good
	1. glibc pass 2
	1. binutils pass 3
1. Add support for more editor
1. See if i can make a release of backup
1. Calculate SBU less accurately, ms and Î¼s are not significant
1. better SBU time (0h0m12s is not clean)
1. better timestamp on log (from timestamp to date)
